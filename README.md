# Extended Micorgrad Framework for Implementing NN (XMicrograd.
Developing a light weight framework for implementing popular neural network methods such as CNNs, MLPs, etc. 
This repository will contain the framework and its tests as well as example implementation of each method in Pytorh and XMicrograd

#### NB: This will come in later. for now I'd focus on building these architectures up till GNNs with the basic module (torch) without torch.nn.
